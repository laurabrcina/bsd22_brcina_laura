was invented for quick calculations of various complex numbers.
Accordingly, the calculating machine should help us in daily use.</p>

calculator in Java</h2>
<p>The main task of a simple calculator is to read in two simple values
from the keyboard and then to display the result on the screen.
Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication will usually be
possible as arithmetic operations.</p>
<h2 id="programming-complex-calculators-in-java">Programming complex
calculators in Java</h2>
<p>In contrast to the simple one, you can also program a more complex
calculator in Java, which can carry out several calculations at once. An
example of such a calculator would be a point before a decimal point or
the calculation of several numbers with and without brackets.</p>
